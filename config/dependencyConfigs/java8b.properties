# This is the dependency configuration for Java 8 based runtimes with a post-Checkstyle-8.21 API.
# The core Checkstyle changes introduced with https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/3417 in Checkstyle 8.21
# require that every custom check be linked against the 8.21 API (at least one class is now an interface, while
# retaining its binary name).

# the Checkstyle base version
dependencyVersion.com.puppycrawl.tools = 8.21

# Checkstyle versions which we expect to be compatible with the base version above
