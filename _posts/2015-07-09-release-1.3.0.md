We have a new check called [LocationReference]({{ site.baseurl }}/latest/checks/misc.html#LocationReference) which helps ensure correctness of references to the current method or class name when passed as an argument or used in a variable assignment. Also, we have major improvements to the build process.<!--break-->

Here is the more detailed list:

  - New check: *LocationReference* - This check can be configured to compare a method argument or variable assignment to the names of the current method or class, helping to make sure that such code location references are correct.
  - Reacting to the high volatility of the public Checkstyle API, Checkstyle Addons is now automatically built against all Checkstyle versions that require at least Java 6 (which is 6.0 and upwards). This means more work for the build server, but also much higher confidence that the Checkstyle Addons code will be compatible with any Checkstyle version.
  - For the same reason, Checkstyle Addons can be built explicitly for a particular Checkstyle version by calling `./gradlew -Pcheckstyleaddons_deps=cs6.8.1` (replace `cs6.8.1` with one of the defined [dependency configurations](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/tree/master/project/dependencyConfigs)).
  - Minor improvements to the inner code quality
