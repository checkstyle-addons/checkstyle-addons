Added new property `fileExcludes` to the [PropertyCatalog]({{ site.baseurl }}/v5.2.0/checks/misc.html#PropertyCatalog)
check<!--break-->

Also, some internal improvements are included:

- Internal upgrades to the build process (Gradle 4.1, *java-library* plugin)
- Ensure support of Checkstyle 8.2 (it was already supported with the previous version, but now we ensure that it stays
  that way)
