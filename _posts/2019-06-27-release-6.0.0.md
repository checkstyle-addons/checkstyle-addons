We finally have support for Checkstyle 8.21 and above! For older Checkstyle, you may now have to use a different
variant of {{ site.name }}.<!--break-->

As [announced]({% post_url 2019-05-27-checkstyle-8.21-breaks-custom-checks %}) earlier, this is a major change (new
major version), because the Checkstyle API was changed in a way that cannot be compensated by our internal
CheckstyleApiFixer (classes were changed into interfaces with the same name, so we must re-link everything). The
following change results for {{ site.name }} users:

- By default, this version (v6.0.0) is compatible with Checkstyle ≥&nbsp;8.21. If you want to use
  {{ site.name }}&nbsp;v6.0.0 with older versions of Checkstyle, you must now use the proper variant of {{ site.name }}:

  - Checkstyle ≥&nbsp;8.21: normal {{ site.name }}
  - Checkstyle 7.0 -&nbsp;8.20: use {{ site.name }} "`java8a`" variant
  - Checkstyle 6.17 -&nbsp;6.19: use {{ site.name }} "`java7`" variant (still Java&nbsp;7 compatible)
  - older Checkstyle: use {{ site.name }}&nbsp;v4.x
  
Details may usually be found in the [Checkstyle Compatibility Matrix]({{ site.baseurl }}/checkstyle-compatibility-matrix.html).
