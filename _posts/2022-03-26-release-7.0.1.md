*All* artifacts are now published to Maven Central. GitHub release assets are not used anymore.<!--break-->

This became necessary because GitHub no longer allowed the `.jar` file extension in release assets.

In order to comply with Maven Central requirements, the names of the Eclipse and SonarQube plugin jars have changed:

- checkstyle-addons-eclipse-7.0.0.jar → checkstyle-addons-7.0.1-eclipse.jar
- sonar-checkstyleaddons-7.0.0.jar → checkstyle-addons-7.0.1-sonar.jar

Everything else remains the same!

More details on which files are needed for which setups may be found in the
[download guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/v7.0.1/download-guide.html).
