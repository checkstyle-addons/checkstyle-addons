This release contains only minor enhancements, such as a new placeholder that is available for the
`propertyFile` option of the
[PropertyCatalog](http://checkstyle-addons.thomasjensen.com/v4.0.0/checks/misc.html#PropertyCatalog) check.
Also added support for Java&nbsp;8.<!--break-->

This is a new major version because starting with Checkstyle 7.0, Checkstyle requires Java&nbsp;8. So,
{{ site.name }} is now also compiled for Java&nbsp;8 by default. If you are on a previous Java version,
that's fine! You may use the artifacts postfixed with `java7` or `java6`, respectively. They are
functionally equivalent, but work with previous levels of Java and the corresponding older versions of Checkstyle.
