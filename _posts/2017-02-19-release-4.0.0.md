Following the Checkstyle lead, {{ site.name }} has also moved to Java&nbsp;8 (hence the new major version).
Plus, the `propertyFile` option of the [PropertyCatalog]({{ site.baseurl }}/v4.0.0/checks/misc.html#PropertyCatalog) check
features a new placeholder.<!--break-->

Starting with Checkstyle 7.0, Checkstyle requires Java&nbsp;8. So, {{ site.name }} is now also compiled
for Java&nbsp;8 by default. If you are on a previous Java version, that's fine! You may use the artifacts
postfixed with `java7` or `java6`, respectively. They are functionally equivalent, but work with previous
levels of Java and the corresponding older versions of Checkstyle.
