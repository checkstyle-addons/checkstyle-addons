This is a maintenance release, including one minor bug fix. No need to upgrade per se.<!--break-->

The fix included is for an obscure case where an error message about an unsupported token was not created correctly.
This bug has been with {{ site.name }} almost forever, but since the Java release cadence stepped up, it is more likely
to occur.
