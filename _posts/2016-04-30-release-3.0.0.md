The new check called [ModuleDirectoryLayout]({{ site.url }}/v3.0.0/checks/misc.html#ModuleDirectoryLayout) helps ensure
that the modules of a project follow a configurable directory layout.<!--break-->
One such layout is the [Maven Standard Directory
Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html),
but you can define your own!
Also, there are some minor improvements to the *RegexpOnString* check and minor fixes.

This is a new major version because the dependency structure has changed. We now depend on some external libraries
other than Checkstyle. IntelliJ and command line users will have to use the new `-all` artifact which includes the
external libraries so that nothing else needs to be downloaded.
