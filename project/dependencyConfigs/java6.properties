# This dependency configuration will build the latest possible version that still runs on Java 6. This has some effect
# on the setup of the runtime environments, but assuming you have a working Java 6 based runtime, then you will be
# able to use Checkstyle Addons, too! Note that the exact Checkstyle version 6.1 (not 6.1.1 or anything else!) is
# required for this to work (rationale: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/505). For IntelliJ, this means
# using Checkstyle-IDEA 4.10.0 exactly.

# the Checkstyle base version
dependencyVersion.com.puppycrawl.tools = 6.1

# Checkstyle versions which we expect to be compatible with the base version above
CompatibleWithCheckstyle = 6.0, 6.1.1
