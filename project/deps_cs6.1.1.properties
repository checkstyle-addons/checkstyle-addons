# Dependency configuration: cs6.1.1

Description = Latest Checkstyle version that still runs on Java 7 in IntelliJ IDEA

# This dependency configuration will build the latest possible version that still runs on Java 7 in IntelliJ IDEA.
# Since the Checkstyle-IDEA maintainer single-handedly decided to require Java 8 even when Checkstyle itself did not,
# one cannot upgrade past Checkstyle 6.1.1 if running IntelliJ on Java 7. Checkstyle 6.1.1 is a broken version, so
# this version of Checkstyle Addons will not run on SonarQube. In Eclipse, it will run if the exact version 6.1.1
# of the Eclipse plugin is used. (It will generally work only with the exact Checkstyle version 6.1.1.)
