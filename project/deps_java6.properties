# Dependency configuration: java6

Description = Latest Checkstyle version that still runs on Java 7 everywhere. The IntelliJ IDE must run on Java 8, \
but the JDK used for the Java code may still be Java 7. This is a good compromise for Java 7 based development.

Checkstyle = 6.4.1

Java = 1.7
FindBugs = 3.0.0

SonarQube = 3.0
SQManifest = 4.5.1
SQJavaPlugin = 2.2
SQCheckstylePlugin = 2.3
